# Fragments Of Reality: A World Reimagined

## 🎮 About the Game

Fragments Of Reality is an immersive first-person puzzle adventure built in Unreal Engine 5. You step into the shoes of a journalist armed with a camera, capable of transforming the world through photography. With each snapshot, you restore light, color, and harmony to a world that has lost its vibrance.

## 📸 Gameplay Overview

### Level 1: Restoring the Light

The world is shrouded in darkness, but your camera holds the key to illumination. As you photograph dark objects, they become emissive sources of light, revealing the world’s hidden details and leading you forward.

### Level 2: Bringing Back Color

Everything is bleak, drained of its hues. Through your lens, you breathe life into the world—each captured image restores the natural colors of objects, turning a grayscale reality into a vivid masterpiece.

### Level 3: Organizing the Chaos

Toy cars of rainbow colors roam chaotically in the final challenge. Your task? Snap them at the perfect moment to stop them under their corresponding streetlight. A test of precision, timing, and perception!

## 🎨 Development & Learnings

Throughout the development process, I explored and mastered various aspects of Unreal Engine 5, including:

✅ Lighting & Emissive Materials – Learned how to use lighting effects dynamically to enhance immersion.
✅ Post-Processing & Color Grading – Experimented with black-and-white effects and real-time color transformations.
✅ Blueprint Scripting & Interactivity – Developed intricate mechanics using Blueprints to make the world react to photography.

This project was an incredible learning experience, allowing me to sharpen my skills in game design, problem-solving, and creative storytelling through interactive media.
